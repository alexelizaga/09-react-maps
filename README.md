# Good practices

## Separate

- Imports ( external, own, css/... )
- Properties and Methods

## Short Lines Ascending ( shift + command/control + p)

- Own imports, external imports ascending by importance
- Atributes
- Properties
- Methods

## TSX VS TS

- TSX when the component export JSX
- TS when the component doesn't export JSX

## HomeScreen and MapView
- Component starts with capital letter

## single quote vs doble quote
- "" Just for html

## useEffect
- Can't be async
- Just do one thing by useEffect

## interfaces
- First letter of the name of the interface is capital
- No index.ts for interfaces
- use https://quicktype.io to generate response interfaces
